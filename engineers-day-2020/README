# Engineer's Day 2020

This presentation was given as an introduction to open source hardware, software
and OSs to students at [BVRIT Hyderabad](http://bvrithyderabad.edu.in/).

## Building the slides

To build the slides, you will need [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and the Source
Sans Pro font. Just run `make` to build them. If you don't have the font, you
can remove the respective line from the `Makefile`, or just rewrite it / pick up
the command from there and adjust it if you have a different environment.
