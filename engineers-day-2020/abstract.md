## PSLab - A Full-stack Open Experimentation Kit

PSLab (pslab.io) is open hardware, firmware, and software, including tutorials
and documentation with apps for both desktop and mobile phones.
This presentation gives a rough overview of what the device offers, the overall
architecture and stack, and where the project currently is in terms of
development.

## About me

I am a software engineer with backgrounds in IT security and computer science,
working as a full-stack web developer in ecommerce, and contributing to free and
open source operating systems and distributions as well as hardware, firmware
and software projects. Currently I am mostly involved in LinuxBoot, u-root,
coreboot, oreboot, webboot, Arch Linux, Harvey OS, and FOSSASIA's PSLab, besides
investigating firmware I find in numerous devices.
