# PSLab at Open Up Summit 2020

This presentation was given at [Open UP Summit](https://www.openup.global/).
See also the [abstract](abstract.md).

## Building the slides

To build the slides, you will need [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and the Source
Sans Pro font. Just run `make` to build them. If you don't have the font, you
can remove the respective line from the `Makefile`, or just rewrite it / pick up
the command from there and adjust it if you have a different environment.
